            It is better for students to start looking for part-time work in their 1st and 2nd year.<br>
            In the final years, studying is no more difficult, but it will seem that the workload has become higher.<br>
            Moreover, the approach of the graduation project will make students nervous. What are your thoughts on a part-time job?
            If you manage to find an excellent vacancy during the 2nd and 3rd courses, then in a couple of months<br>
            you will be able to adapt to the new educational and work regime.<br>
            After six months, it will become quite easy for you to combine all your<br>
            responsibilities and even writing a thesis will not affect your part-time job.
